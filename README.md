# StockSearchApp

## Project Description
A mobile app version of StockSearchWeb. An Android mobile application, which allows users to search for stock information, save some stock symbols
as favorites, and post to the Facebook timeline.
The main “scene” of this app is like the one shown in Figure 1, where the user can enter the
stock ticker symbol and select from a list of matching stock symbols using “autocomplete.” A
“stock quote” on a matched stock symbol can be retrieved.
Once the user has entered some characters in the edit box and selected a matching result from
the autocomplete list, he/she would click on Get Quote, at which point validation must be done
to check that the entered data is not empty.
